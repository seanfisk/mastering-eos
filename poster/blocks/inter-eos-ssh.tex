\begin{block}{Inter-EOS password-less SSH}
  Secure Shell is a protocol that is used to remotely control machines. Under normal circumstances, you must type a password to log in. However, by setting up trust, no password is necessary to SSH between EOS machines.
  \begin{indented}
    {\scriptsize
\begin{bashcode}
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen # Press Enter at each prompt
# Add new SSH key to authorized_keys
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
_trust_host() {
	ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ConnectTimeout=2 "$1" exit
}
# Trust all EOS machines
for i in {1..24}; do _trust_host "eos$(printf '%02d' $i)"; done
# Trust all Arch machines
for i in {1..10}; do _trust_host "arch$(printf '%02d' $i)"; done
ssh eos15 # Automatic login
\end{bashcode}
}
\end{indented}
For more security, use a passphrase and \clicode{ssh-agent}.
