\begin{block}{Installing software to your EOS account}
  Installs version 1.17.0 of aria2, a download utility similar to Wget but with more features. This install is typical of many programs using the GNU build system. The option of note is the \clicode{--prefix} option to \clicode{./configure}. You may install to any directory you like, but \url{\~/.local} is a common convention. \\
