Checking Host Fingerprints
==========================

When logging in to an EOS machine for the first time, you will see a message like this::

   The authenticity of host 'eos01.cis.gvsu.edu (148.61.162.101)' can't be established.
   RSA key fingerprint is 6d:29:fd:23:c5:26:c7:c9:a5:6e:6e:c2:34:60:ea:54.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
