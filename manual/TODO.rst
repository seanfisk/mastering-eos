* Remote

    * SFTP
        * Cyberduck looks good for Mac and Win

    * Focus on Bash and just mention other shells at the end
    * Add path manip section
    * Add prompt customization section
    * "Next class" Python module in prompt, e.g., ``<CIS452 in 01:42>``.

    * Web server details (info.php)

* Later, tryout http://www.mremoteng.org/ and http://terminals.codeplex.com/.

* Be clear about keycard Datacomm vs. EOS/Arch access.

* Sean asks: Are we going to deploy man and info pages? They are commented out right now because they haven't been updated in a while. If we aren't going to keep them updated, we should remove them from the systems.

* Sean asks: Is it OK to use the GVSU favicon?

* Sean asks: Is it possible to install Remmina on EOS?
