======================
 Rules and Procedures
======================

It is important that some basic rules and procedures be established to help maintain the lab and aid in its shared use.  To those ends, please be aware of the following guidelines:


Disk Space
==========

You are given 8 gigabytes (GB) of disk space. Once you exceed this limit, you can no longer store data on the system. This often leads to being unable to login via a graphical session, as the desktop manager must be able to write to disk. You must then log in via a text-based console and delete files to make space.

Copyrighted Material
====================

Any files may be stored in your home directory. This includes games, movies, and music. However, allowing others to transfer copyrighted material may constitute a copyright infringement.

These incidents are usually caused by unintentional permissions issues or deliberate misuse of the system. Whatever the cause, copyright infringement is a violation of school policy.

These cases are taken very seriously. Your user account will be terminated immediatly upon discovering the infringement. Additionally, this offense is against our school's honor code, so you may be expelled or even face criminal proceedings.

Suffice to say, please be very careful when dealing with copyrighted materials within the EOS system. Be familiar with how permissions work, and take the time to set them correctly.

Food and Drink
==============

You are encouraged to eat and drink in the labs --- these labs were made for you and we want them to be as comfortable and useful as possible. Many restaraunts in the area deliver to the labs, including Papa John's and Jimmy John's. However, it is your responsibility to clean up after yourself. If the lab becomes too messy, policies to limit food and drinks will be instituted.

Overnight Parking
=================

Even if you have a parking pass, it is still neccessary to obtain a special permit to park overnight. These permits are granted by Campus Safety. Parking overnight without one of these permits can result in a ticket or towing.

Living in the Lab
=================

It should go without saying (but hasn't in the past) that you cannot live in the lab. People have been found living in the lab for brief periods of time between leases, etc. We must note that this is not only a huge safety violation but is illegal. If caught living in the lab, you will be removed and Campus Safety notified.

Malicious Activity
==================

The infrastructure provided by the EOS Labs includes very powerful tools that can be used to secure network infrastructure.  Unfortunately, these tools may also be used for malicious purposes. We provide these tools for you to learn to defend future systems it may be your job to secure. Under no circumstances should these tools be used to attack other students, machines, or entities. We do not provide these resources without reasonable oversight as to their use, and those using them illegally will be noticed and face strong consequences --- possibly including removal from the university and criminal charges.

Games
=====

We encourage playing games in the lab. However, if you are playing games and all machines are currently in use, please be polite and yield your machine to students needing to complete coursework.  Failure to do so may result in suspension of your account, or all games being removed from the system.
