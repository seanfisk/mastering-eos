 Remote Access (SSH/VNC)
=========================

When not sitting at a physical machine in the EOS, Arch, or Datacomm labs, EOS can be accessed from home using a protocol called Secure Shell (SSH). SSH gives you a prompt open to :ref:`bash`, the default shell on EOS. From this shell, you can run commands as you would inside a normal terminal emulator in an EOS desktop session. The commands will be run on the EOS machine to which you have connected.

SSH is a command-line-only technology. However, a graphical remote desktop session is available through a protocol called Virtual Network Computing (VNC). VNC allows access to a graphical desktop as if sitting at an EOS machine. Because the VNC protocol has no security of its own, our lab setup requires tunnelling VNC traffic through the SSH protocol. Each respective guide describes how to do this, but remember that you will first need to successfully set up SSH before attempting to use VNC.

An alternative to starting an entire desktop session is to run individual graphical applications from an SSH session using the :wikipedia:`X Window System <X_Window_System>`. This takes advantage of X's :wikipedia:`network transparency feature <X_Window_System#Purpose_and_abilities>` and SSH's X forwarding capabilities to render on your local machine applications running on an EOS machine.

In addition to command-line and graphical access, you will likely need to transfer files between your local machine and EOS. This can be accomplished using the protocols Secure Copy (SCP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). Using these protocols, files can be transferred to and from EOS as well as synced between EOS and your local machine. In addition, the use of software :wikipedia:`FUSE <Filesystem_in_Userspace>` and :wikipedia:`SSHFS` allows you to treat files on EOS as if they were located on your local machine.

The hostnames for the EOS machines are organized as follows: :samp:`eos{XX}.cis.gvsu.edu` where :samp:`{XX}` is 01 through 32, :samp:`arch{XX}.cis.gvsu.edu` where :samp:`{XX}` is 01 through 10, and :samp:`dc{XX}.cis.gvsu.edu` where :samp:`{XX}` is 01 through 24. Use these names to connect to a specific EOS machine.

Your SSH client, VNC client, and X server of choice depend on your machine's operating system.
